Every Now and Then

Stephen Crawford
This project was created in December of 2020. 
The purpose of this project is to create an interesting, calming musical piece. 
Stylistically, the project uses basic coding structures such as loops and calls, however, the program (which should be run using Sonic Pi: https://sonic-pi.net/), also uses a variety of musical techniques to try to create its target effect. 

Brainstorm:

C, E, G

Guitar riffs good

Even out with slower portions

Try not to repeat same base inside but do at end

Make more random using rrand and on_in()

Repetition is okay but want to have variety outside of individual sections

Avoid using too many odd samples

Bass samples are very electronic sounding

“Hard” percussives have tinny resonance which is unpleasant and not what want

Hard to keep count using the set times, seems to be 4 beats ahead of calculated intro

Stick to 1, 2, and 4 rests as to avoid unwanted off beat sounds 

Try to incorporate crescendo throughout but keep things around 0.5 amp

Rate can be useful but slowing beyond 0.5 creates a lot of distortion


Creating the music:

The process of creating my Sonic Pi piece began with very little thought. When first tasked with the assignment, I took the advice of Sonic Pi creator Sam Aaron and simply began to explore based off of the understanding of the program provided by Professor Sarah Harmon in both her lectures and notes. At first, I decided that I would start easy with middle C and use the common chord progressions I had learned from my own experiences playing the bass and the guitar. I also knew, that as someone who listens to a lot of music--mainly classic rock, punk, and hip hop--I could identify "good" sounding toons should they be created. That being the case, I started out my program with the simple chord progression of C, E, G which we are all so familiar with. 
From this point, I decided to build outwards, hoping to create a more varied piece and explore the soundscape with different amplitudes and rates. However, I realized that while I could rely on my own musical experience to help me get started, I was going to have to learn more about the actual offerings of Sonic Pi if I wanted to create any sort of complex or meaningful piece. As such, I followed the in-program tutorial which taught me about both the adaptation of simple musical elements (such as notes and chords, as well as more complex Sonic Pi specific aspects including the ways in which the interface allows for the manipulation of sounds and how it handles basic data structures such as loops and calls. 

Armed with this new knowledge as well as a lot of time exploring the sample library, I found a few more parts of my program which would go to form my introduction/exposition and gained some very important realizations. Specifically, I learned: 1) all of the sounds in Sonic Pi's library were much louder than they should be; 2) many of the sounds were unusable scrit-scratch which may make for fun songs but would not be relaxing (see: zawa etc.); 3) and that the adjusting of the speeds of many of the samples drastically changed how they sounded as a result of the rate variable both slowing the expression of the noise and stretching the pitch. Also, in my exploration, I found that the included guitar samples were both quite fun to listen to and based on E-base riffs. Whether it be the E minor 9 arpeggio or the e_fifths sample, all the pieces sounded nice and focused on progressions coming from middle E/E minor. This gave me the idea to try to feature these chords throughout the song as well as use them as a sort of "homebase" for the rest of my chord progressions. With regards to backing tempo and percussion instrumentals, I ended up trying to create a sort of mountain shape in the soundscape. That is, I thought that I would start low and slow and then gradually add more and more quicker elements (specifically the unobtrusive snare, tom, and cymbal samples) and build till reaching a point where I would drop off once again. 

After creating my introduction, I thought I was in good position to begin to expand from the foundation I had created. Using the same central chords, I wanted to switch to a different paced tempo, and which had a lighter body. The idea behind this was to offer the audience a sort of mental break considering the relative weight I had begun the song with. I wanted to make sure that I could manage the various aspects including fast beat and low tones I had used in the first section without turning the song from “chill” to eerie or creepy. To this idea, some credit belongs to Emma Bertke, who provided feedback to my song throughout its creation and warned against the use of too many low and potentially ominous sounding notes or sequences. For the backing percussive sequences of this section, I used a vary similar setup to that which I had in the first but tried to slow things down some as to match the intended change in tone. The following middle section, I did largely the same thing so will not discuss with much detail. 

In the fourth section of my song, I wanted to try to create a more randomized and dynamic piece. Using the tutorial within Sonic Pi, I was able to create a variety of different randomized portions which I played with one another in a separate development window (on the bottom of the display window where you type code, you can select different numbers to switch to a secondary, third, etc.… development window). After trying a variety of different setups, I came to realize that I was going to have to choose between making my song sound good or have a greater element of randomization to it. While musicians often “jam” or solo without following a set score, there is a reason they keep a constant beat and do not stray off a set of connecting notes. I found much variation in the rest lengths between elements to be incredibly chaotic and often produce low rumbling sounds as the result of pieces which would play over one another. Nevertheless, I was able to find a nice balance between randomization and the overall quality of my song which I employed to great effect in this section which was intended to act as a sort of “solo” section. I got the idea to put this section here from a course I took callead “Issues in Hip Hop” which at one point noted how common the use of AABA songs patterns were. In these patterns, A certain set was repeated in the pattern of matching all but a third portion of the song. 

Finally, I decided to wrap up my song by replaying the intro in an attempt to bring the variation back together with the rest of the piece and conclude the piece in a memorable fashion.
